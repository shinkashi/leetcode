 * Testcase Example:  '[3,6,9,1]'
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the maximum difference between two
 * successive elements in its sorted form. If the array contains less than two
 * elements, return 0.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra
 * space.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or
 * (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [10]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return
 * 0.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
